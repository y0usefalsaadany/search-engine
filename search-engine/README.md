# search-engine
This is a simple search engine that was made using the TCP protocol. This search engine was designed using PHP, where the search engine communicates with the server through the serverâ€™s IP and port, and the request is sent from the search engine to the server, so the server checks the request in the DNS and then sends accordingly response
